CrystalGrow
===========

Just an interesting program.

## Algorithms

An evolution algorithm.

The program reads an original image and generates the hexagon fitting image.

Each hexagon is regarded as the crystal in the program.

The growing of crystal needs energy which randomly scatters on the input image with more possibility on more light point.

The crystalls compete with each other, for the light and space. The growing of other crystall around one is restrained.

But like the biologic cell, live cost of large crystall is heavy, leading them die at last.

Then a biologic system generated.

The last things to do is just take a screenshot of the processing.
